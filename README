ECE1387 Assignment 3 README file

Please read this file before compiling and launching the branch & bound partitioner.

Please follow the steps below to achieve successful compilation.
1)  Use <cd> to switch to the "assignment3" directory.
2)  Type <make> or <make all> to compile the source code.
    This will generate an executable called "Partitioner-LouisChen".
3)  Type <make clean> if wish to clean the project.

Please follow the steps below to launch the application successfully.
4)  Use <pwd> to make sure current directory is "assignment3".
5)  To run the application, type the following command:

    ./Partitioner-LouisChen <cct-file-path> <-traversal=[dfs|lbf]> <-display=[on|off]>

    For traversal mode, set to dfs for depth-first traversal,
    set to lbf for lowest-bounf-first traversal.

    For decision tree plot, set -display=on to turn it on, otherwise off.

    Example command to run cct1 with depth-first traversal and display off:
    ./Partitioner-LouisChen ./cct1 -traversal=dfs -display=off

6)  The terminal should output initial and final partitions, crossing counts,
    number of nodes expanded, and run-time.

If display is turned on, press "Proceed" to start the partitioner. Press "Proceed"
again to turn off. Please note that the pruned decision tree, once plotted in red,
may disappear if the graphics window is moved or refreshed, since the "drawscreen"
function does not get updated with the pruned plot due to drawing inefficiency and
high run-time.

Hope you had a great time exploring my branch & bound partitioner program! :)
